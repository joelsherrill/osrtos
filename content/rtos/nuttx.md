NuttX is a real-time operating system (RTOS) with an emphasis on standards compliance and small footprint. Scalable from 8-bit to 32-bit microcontroller environments, the primary governing standards in NuttX are Posix and ANSI standards.

### Features

- Standards Compliant.
- Core Task Management.
- Modular, micro-kernel.
- Fully pre-emptible.
- Naturally scalable.
- Highly configurable.
- Easily extensible to new processor architectures, SoC architecture, or board architectures. See Porting Guide.
- FIFO and round-robin scheduling.
- Realtime, deterministic, with support for priority inheritance.
- POSIX/ANSI-like task controls, named message queues, counting semaphores, clocks/timers, signals, pthreads, environment variables, filesystem.
- VxWorks-like task management and watchdog timers.
- BSD socket interface.
- Extensions to manage pre-emption.
- Optional tasks with address environments (Processes).
- Inheritable

### Demo Projects

- [PX4](http://pixhawk.org/choice). PX4 is an independent, open-source, open-hardware project aiming at providing a high-end autopilot to the academic, hobby and industrial communities (BSD licensed) at low costs and high availability.
